## Who was the audience?

Regulators, Capital One associates utilizing data, and privacy-minded consumers looking to exercise their data rights.

## What did I work on?
  
1. Designing UI and user flow for an overhaul of the privacy decision-making business process; specifically, determining whether a dataset contained personally identifiable information (PII) that consumers could request to download, correct, or delete.
2. Continuing efforts to expand the UI to include consumer controls required by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), minimizing compliance risk, and proposing measurable improvements to the data request portal.
3. Designing a transparency report for web and mobile to reduce compliance risk.

## What was the point of all this?

- To **centralize** the privacy, compliance, and governance process by integrating automated controls within a data management platform which I'll call OneData (not the actual name).  
- To **anticipate** privacy legislation, especially after California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and with California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) right on the horizon.

## Accomplishments  

- Partnered with another designer to create a **business process flow** in Google Draw to share with product managers based on documentation and interviews with managers who walked me through the manual privacy review process.
- Supported the research team to facilitate **moderated user interviews** for **user testing** components of the new process. Also supported their competitive analysis determining how Capital One's experience compared in the financial and tech landscape. The insights influenced the product definition and alignment between design, research, and product partners.  
- Partnered with product to test a **clickable-prototype** I designed in **Figma**, which helped document the new process. The components I designed were either in accordance with the  enterprise **design system** or proposed enhancements that based on need for users beyond privacy. 
- Designed UI in **Figma** allowing consumers to see past their request history and conducted unmoderated **usability testing**using **usertesting.com** to ensure that the new design did not impact usability. I measured success based on task completion and found that with the majority of customers could find and complete the intended tasks and the new correction feature, per CPRA requirement.  
  
_The new process launched with the UI components in a closed pilot which generated an NPS of 50 and 75% ease of use score from managers and directors across multiple LOBs with heavy datasets, who were the most overburdened by the current process. It also drove business efficiencies, including a 50% decrease in the number of days to decide a dataset, and on average, saved ~500 hours/month in employee time._

## Feedback  


## TL;DR

- Designed UI for a new business process to alleviate Capital One associates from a highly manual and repetitive side-of-desk task.
- The new process eliminated time-consuming manual reviews of datasets, making progress towards reducing costs from heavy contractor deployment and consolidating the federated fulfillment process across lines of business.
- Reduced compliance risk and provided customers with more fine-grained privacy controls for an enhanced privacy experience.
