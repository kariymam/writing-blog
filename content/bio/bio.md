# What's this?
I'm here to claim a little piece of the internet for myself. It's a blog, but I hope it can be a digital sketchbook for weaving threads of my personal through line.

So when my brain is bogged down by work and living in a capitalist hellscape, I can come here and tinker with thoughts, art, code, or something else.
