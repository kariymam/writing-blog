## A note about my "case study" style

1. If you're looking for post-its, FigJams, Figma prototypes, or screenshots of any proprietary information I would've created for Capital One decks that would be locked down behind a corporate intranet, well... I'm sorry, they're just not here. I couldn't bust them out of the firewall. All I can try to do for you, dear reader, is share what I did and some anonymous feedback I received during my time.
2. I'm going off of my memories, so details are hazy as I can't remember what I ate for breakfast three days ago.
